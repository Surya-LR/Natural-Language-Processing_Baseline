# Natural Language Processing SVM(Linear SVC)  Baseline

After initially experimenting with various options on a smaller subset of the training dataset (10K)
and RandomisedSearchCV, The Linear SVC was chosen as the SVM model to tune. LinearSVC
was preferred over SVC with the linear kernel as it scales better to large numbers of samples
(Scikitlearn 2021)
