# Natural Language Processing SVM(Linear SVC)  Baseline

After initially experimenting with various options on a smaller subset of the training dataset (10K)
and RandomisedSearchCV, The Linear SVC was chosen as the SVM model to tune. LinearSVC
was preferred over SVC with the linear kernel as it scales better to large numbers of samples
(Scikitlearn 2021)

Data used was The Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) Corpus from https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/snli/

## Bert based models

The Albert and Legal-Bert cannot be shared as it is was developed and paid for by the Company
